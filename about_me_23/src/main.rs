    Create a new `about_me` project with the `cargo new` command.  x

    Using the `println!` macro, output 3 sentences about yourself. x
    Feel free to invoke the macro multiple times.

    From the Terminal, compile the `main.rs` file inside the `src`
    folder with the Rust compiler, then manually run the executable. x

    From the Terminal, compile the project with the Cargo tool, then
    manually run the executable.

    From the Terminal, compile and run the project with a single
    Cargo command.

    Check your program for errors with `cargo check`.

    Add a comment at the top of your source code explaining how to
    compile the program for new Rust developers.

    Add some spaces and line breaks to the code so that it is formatted
    in an ugly manner. From the Terminal, style the code with the
    `cargo fmt` command.                                             x

    Replace the `println!` macro with `print!`. What happens?
